# ML.SilicaPredict

In this repository i implemented a Silica concentration predictor that comes out in the foam flotation process in the mining
industry using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. For this purpose, public data was used and two different techniques was implemented: Random Forest (RF) and 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). 
Finally, the mencined techniques was tested and compared in terms of %error, mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE) and square error (RMSE) as appropriate.
